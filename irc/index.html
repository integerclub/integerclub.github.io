<h1><a href="./">Integer Club IRC User Guide</a></h1>

<p>
  There is a channel for the Integer Club community at the Freenode
  IRC network. Some members of the community hang out in this channel.
  This is an open channel and anyone interested in mathematics, computer
  science, and algorithms are welcome to join this channel and be a part
  of the community.
</p>
<p>
  This guide describes the connection details, an example of how to
  connect and some nifty commands for IRC users and operators.
</p>

<h2 id="connection"><a href="#connection">Connection Details</a></h2>

<p>
  Use the following connection details to connect to our channel.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Network: chat.freenode.net</li>
  <li>Channel: #integerclub</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The above connection details are required while connecting to our
  channel via Webchat or an IRC client. The next two sections
  elaborate this further. While there are many IRC clients available
  on the web, we choose Pidgin to demonstrate how to connect to our
  channel.
</p>


<h2 id="webchat"><a href="#webchat">Webchat</a></h2>
<p>
  This method of connecting via the web based interface does not require
  the installation of any additional tools. This is the simplest method
  to connect to our channel.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
  Visit <a
  href="https://webchat.freenode.net/#integerclub">https://webchat.freenode.net/#integerclub</a>
  with your web browser.
</li>
<li>
  Enter a nickname of your choice.
</li>
<li>
  If you are new to the Freenode network, you would not have your
  nickname registered with the network, so ignore this point. If you
  have registered your nickname before, and you want to connect using
  your password, select <i>I have a password</i>, and enter your
  password.
</li>
<li>
  Click <i>Start</i>.
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="pidgin"><a href="#pidgin">Pidgin</a></h2>
<p>
  There are many IRC clients available on the web. For the sake of
  brevity, we want to demonstrate how to connect to our channel with
  only one of them. We choose Pidgin as the client here.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
  Download Pidgin from
  <a href="https://pidgin.im/">https://pidgin.im/</a> and install
  it.
  <ul>
  <li>
    If you are on Mac and use <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>,
    you may install it by entering the following command.
    <pre>brew install pidgin</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    On a Debian or Ubuntu based system, you may install it by entering
    the following command.
    <pre>apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install pidgin</pre>
  </li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>
  Run Pidgin.
</li>
<li>
  From the menu, select <i>Accounts</i> &gt; <i>Manage Accounts</i>.
</li>
<li>
  Click <i>Add</i>.
</li>
<li>
  In the <i>Basic</i> tab, set the following details.
  <ul>
  <li><i>Protocol:</i> IRC</li>
  <li><i>Username:</i> A nickname of your choice</li>
  <li><i>Server:</i> chat.freenode.net</li>
  <li>
    <i>Password</i>: You may leave this blank if you are connecting
    for the first time. If you have registered your nickname before,
    enter your password here.
  </li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>
  Go to <i>Advanced</i> tab and set the following details.
  <ul>
    <li><i>Port:</i> 6697</li>
    <li>Select <i>Use SSL</i>.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>
  Click <i>Add</i>. Click <i>Close</i>.
</li>
<li>
  Wait for the status of Pidgin to change to <i>Available</i> with a
  green disc.
</li>
<li>
  From the menu, select <i>Buddies</i> &gt; <i>Join a Chat.</i>. Enter
  the following details.
  <ul>
  <li><i>Account:</i> Set it to the account that was just created.</li>
  <li><i>Channel:</i> #integerclub</li>
  <li>
    <i>Password:</i> Leave this blank. Our channel does not require
    password.
  </li>
  </ul>
<li>
  Click <i>Join</i>.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
  As an alternative to the last two steps, if you find that new
  Freenode tabs open after the status changes to <i>Available</i>, you
  may simply enter the following command where you would normally type
  a chat message.
</p>
<pre>/join #integerclub</pre>


<h2 id="bots"><a href="#bots">NickServ and ChanServ</a></h2>
<p>
  There are two bots, NickServ and ChanServ, which help us with
  nickname and channel management activities. This is explained in the
  sections below.
</p>


<h2 id="register"><a href="#register">Register Nickname</a></h2>
<p>
  Once you have connected to the network, you can register your
  nickname. Traditionally, there was no concept of nickname registration
  in IRC. Anyone was free to use any unused nickname. But nowadays, in
  many IRC networks including Freenode, you can register a nickname to
  ensure that someone else cannot use your nickname.
</p>

<p>
  To register the nickname, enter the following command on the IRC
  client. Remember to enter the password you want and your actual
  email address as the last two arguments in the command below.
</p>

<pre>/msg nickserv register <i>password</i> <i>email</i></pre>

<p>
  You would receive an email with further instructions about
  completing the registration. Follow these instructions and complete
  the registration.
</p>

<p>
  After you have registered, you can identify yourself to the network
  while connecting by entering your password in the <i>Password</i>
  field.
</p>

<p>
  To identify yourself to the network while you are connected without
  reconnecting, enter the following command.
</p>

<pre>/msg nickserv identify <i>password</i></pre>

<p>
  Note that simply registering your nickname doesn't prevent anyone
  else from using your nick when you are absent. It only ensures that
  you can recover your nick when you are online even if someone else
  is using it.
</p>

<p>
  If you really want to ensure that nobody else is able to use your
  nick
  even when you are absent, enter the following command.
</p>

<pre>/msg nickserv set enforce on</pre>

<p>
  This ensures that even if someone uses your nick when you are
  absent, he is forced to change his nick within 30 seconds.
</p>


<h2 id="recover"><a href="#recover">Recover Nickname</a></h2>

<p>
  There are usually two situations in which you would want to recover
  your nick.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
  Someone else is using your nick.
</li>
<li>
  You got disconnected from the network abruptly due to network issues
  but when you try to connect again, the server tells you that the nick
  is already being used. This happens when the server doesn't realize
  that your connection was terminated due to network issues. This is
  called a ghost connection. The server automatically terminates the
  ghost connection after a timeout of about 4.5 minutes.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
To recover your nick, enter the following command.
</p>

<pre>/msg nickserv ghost <i>nick</i> <i>password</i></pre>

<p>
After executing that the server will tell you that the nickname has been
ghosted. Now, you can change acquire your actual nick again with the
command: <code>/nick <i>nick</i></code>.
</p>


<h2 id="user-cheat-sheet"><a href="#user-cheat-sheet">User Cheat Sheet</a></h2>

<p>
  All IRC commands begin with a forward slash, i.e. <code>/</code>.
  Here is a list of some useful commands.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
  Change nickname.
  <pre>/nick <i>newnick</i></pre>
</li>
<li>
  Join a channel.
  <pre>/join <i>channelname</i></pre>
</li>
<li>
  Find information about another user.
  <pre>/whois <i>nick</i>
/msg nickserv info <i>nick</i></pre>
</li>
<li>
  Recover your nick.
  <pre>/msg nickserv ghost <i>nick</i> <i>password</i></pre>
</li>
<li>
  Register your nick.
  <pre>/msg nickserv register <i>password</i> <i>email</i></pre>
</li>
<li>
  Identify yourself to the network.
  <pre>/msg nickserv identify <i>password</i></pre>
</li>
</ol>


<h2 id="op-cheat-sheet"><a href="#op-cheat-sheet">Operator Cheat Sheet</a></h2>
<p>
  This section is relevant only to a channel operator. Founder of a
  channel, its operators or Freenode staff can add users as new
  operators of a channel. Here is a list of commands that are useful
  to a channel operator.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Become an operator.
    <pre>/msg chanserv op #integerclub</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Become a normal user again with any one of the following
    commands. It is good etiquette to deop yourself when you don't
    need the operator privilege.
    <pre>/msg chanserv deop #integerclub
/deop #integerclub
/mode -o #integerclub</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Change topic of a channel. You may run the first command as a
    normal user as long as you have operator access for the
    channel. You may be required to become an operator before
    running the second command.
    <pre>/msg chanserv topic #integerclub <i>New topic</i>
/topic <i>New topic</i></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Mute a troll based on nickname.
    <pre>/mode +q <i>nick</i></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Unmute a user based on nickname.
    <pre>/mode -q <i>nick</i></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Mute a troll based on hostmask. Sometimes a troll may
    reconnect with different nicks and spam the channel. In such a
    case, the troll may be muted based on their hostmask.
    <pre>/mode +q *!*@<i>hostmask</i></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Find the hostmask of a nickname.
    <pre>/whois <i>nick</i></pre>
    Look for a pattern that looks like
    <code><i>username</i>@<i>hostmask</i></code> in the output. The
    hostmask part may be a domain name, an IP address or a cloak.
    This part may be used to mute a troll in the command described
    in the previous point.
  </li>
  <li>
    The following ChanServ commands automatically figures out the
    hostmask of a nick and mutes or unmutes a nick based on its
    hostmask.
    <pre>/msg chanserv quiet #integerclub <i>nick</i>
/msg chanserv unquiet #integerclub <i>nick</i></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Ban a troll, i.e. mute the troll and prevent the troll from
    joining the channel again.
    <pre>/mode +b <i>nick</i></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Unban a user.
    <pre>/mode -b <i>nick</i></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Kick a troll out of the channel.
    <pre>/kick <i>nick</i></pre>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
Let us see a few examples of how to mute a troll based on hostname or
cloak.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
  Mute the hostname in <code>~chatzilla@tuwien.teleweb.at</code>.
  <pre>/mode +q *!*@tuwien.teleweb.at</pre>
</li>
<li>
  Mute the IP address in <code>~zumbi@77.230.237.25</code>.
  <pre>/mode +q *!*@77.230.237.25</pre>
</li>
<li>
  Mute the cloak in <code>~humpty@unaffiliated/humpty</code>.
  <pre>/mode +q *!*@unaffiliated/humpty</pre>
</li>
</ul>
