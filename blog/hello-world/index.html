Welcome to <a href="../../">Integer Club</a>.

<p>
This community was formed to promote discussion and collaboration
between people who love mathematics but are not necessarily
mathematicians. The discussions in this community mostly hover around
mathematics, computer science, and algorithms. If you find these topics
interesting, you are welcome to <a href="../../join/">join us</a> and be a part
of our community. You are also welcome to invite your friends and colleagues
and help this community grow.

Apart from the group mailing list, there are Slack and IRC channels for
the community as well. To learn more about the other channels, please
